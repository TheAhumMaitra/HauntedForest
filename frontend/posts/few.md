Hello World! This is my first blog post! In this post, you are going to learn about this website!

## How did I created this?

Well, I used - **Next JS** for creating the website, **Shacdn UI and Tailwind CSS** for applying styles and adding some components, **React Bits** for adding some animations, **Contentlayer** for adding markdown blog feature!




I hope you liked my website! Thanks!
