**Hello, everyone! I hope you all are doing great!**

So, I created an TUI app called **Itomori**. Which is helps you to write quick and short notes! I t stores notes in `json` format, which is good! It shows you notes on table formatted way, which is pretty good.

The app is useful and good but every app has some _pros_ and _cons_ . Today, I'm going to give my app a honest review!


**Pros:**
---
1. It's blazingly fast
2. It's keyboard driven, everything is accessible via **keyboard**
3. Keeps logs
4. Easy `json` storing data style
5. Beautiful layout and multiple themes
6. Easy installation


**Cons:**
---
1. The app has few features
2. The app keeps wrong logs
3. This app can break on less known terminal
4. Itomori's table formatting data style can be overwhelming

That's it for today! I hope you all are going to have a lovely Christmas! Merry Christmas! See ya!
